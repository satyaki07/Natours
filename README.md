### ```@keyframes``` animations
This feature allows for elements to transition from one position to another. This is achieved by defining where elements are positioned at the beginning and at the end of the animation (defined as 0% - 100%  - see below).

### Image Transitions
Each image is emphasized as it's hovered over giving a 3d-esque feel to the webpage. This is achieved by scaling-up the current image being hovered over and scale-down the other photos.

### Card Animations
Probably my most favorite feature of this page. This card animation is achieved by creating two div elements, front-side and back side, styled to be on top of each other achieved by the property ```backface-visibility: hidden``` and then giving each side it's own styling accordingly. This segment of this page also reuses the button component similar to the "Discover our tours" button at the top of the page.
